This project offers an interface to use Jess (Java Expert System Shell) to build expert systems to control bots in Robocode. The interface is called CommunicationBot and uses messages in the form of strings to communicate events generated by robocode to a server application running Jess code. The server parses the strings and generate objects that can be fed into Jess engine to retrive actions, and send them back to the bot.
